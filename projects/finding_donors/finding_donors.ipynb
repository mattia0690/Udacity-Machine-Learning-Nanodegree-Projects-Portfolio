    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVC)\n",
    "- Some of the real-world application of the Support Vector Machne algorithm are: face detection, text and hypertext categorization, classification of images, bioinformatics (protein classification and cancer classification. They use SVM for identifying the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems),protein fold and remote homology detection (apply SVM algorithms for protein remote homology detection) and handwriting recognition.\n",
    "- They work really well in complicated domains where there is a clear margin of separation. Using a non-linear SVM kernel means that the boundary that the algorithm calculates doesn't have to be a straight line. The benefit is that you can capture much more complex relationships between your data points without having to perform difficult transformations on your own.\n",
    "- Don't perform so well in very large data sets, because the training time happens to be cubic in the size of the data set. Also, it doesn't work very well with lots and lots of noise. So when the class are very overlapping you have to count independent evidence. That's where the naive Bayes classifier would be better.\n",

    "RANDOM FOREST\n",
    "- The random forest algorithm is used in a lot of different fields, like Banking, Stock Market, Medicine and E-Commerce. In Banking it is used for example to detect customers who will use the bank’s services more frequently than others and repay their debt in time. In this domain, it is also used to detect fraud customers who want to scam the bank. In finance, it is used to determine a stock’s behaviour in the future. In the healthcare domain, it is used to identify the correct combination of components in medicine and to analyze a patient’s medical history to identify diseases. And lastly, in E-commerce random forest is used to determine whether a customer will actually like the product or not. ( \"The Random Forest Algorithm\" by Niklas Donges)\n",
    "- Each tree of the model is trained on a sample set retrieved from the total of the training data, a technique know as bagging or bootstrap aggregation. This enforces the independence of each tree. Then the ensemble classifier aggregates all the individual predictions to combine into a final prediction, based on a majority voting on the individual predictions. The randomness of the model, guaranteed in addition by the fact that each small tree takes into consideration a random subset of the available features, help to prevent overfitting problems. It takes into account the independence of the attributes by working in parallel decision trees. As a result, the bias of the forest increases slightly, but due to the averaging of less correlated trees, its variance decreases, resulting in an overall better model. (\"Ensemble Learning to Improve Machine Learning Results\" by Vadim Smolyakov). Moreover, the runtime is quite fast.\n",
    "- With particularly noise data it may run into the over-fit problem. Also, in practice, it is not possible to guarantee the independence of each classifier inside the forest, as they are trained from the same data, but we are still introducing some randomness that helps achieve independence to a certain degree.\n",
    "- This model is a good candidate for our problem considering the high volume of data and the high number of independent features that can be used to train independent trees.\n",

    "GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES\n",
    "- Commonly used for categorizing news, email spam detection, face recognition, sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis, digit recognition and weather prediction are just few of the popular use cases of Naive Bayes algorithm.\n",
    "- Naive-Bayesian classifiers are very robust to irrelevant attributes, and classification takes into account evidence from many attributes to make the final prediction, a property that is useful in many cases where there is no “main effect.” (as cited in the article by Ron Kohavi, linked in the script itself, \"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"). This seems to fit our problem where we have a high number of attributes, 13, and we don't know which one should drive our prediction and which one is less relevant. It is also really easy to implement and efficient.\n",
    "- On the downside, NaiveBayes classifiers require making strong independence assumptions and when these are violated, the achievable accuracy may asymptote early and will not improve much as the database size increases. (\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"). That could represent an issue for us since we don't know if the attributes independency assumption is very strong or not.\n",
    "- Considering the high number of attributes and the fact that we don't know which one could be more relevant than others, this model seems to fit the problem since takes into account evidence from many attributes to make the final prediction."

    "The Random forests model is an ensemble learning method for classification, it builds a multitude of decision trees at training time and makes the prediction based on the average of results coming from all the decision trees present in the forest. \n",

This process continues until the data reach the bottom level of the tree, where it is labelled in one of the buckets.\n",
    "Each decision tree, that constitutes the forest,  take into account a random subgroup of the total available features to classify the training points. When a prediction is made, the data pass through all the trees and the final result is based on the average of the results of all the trees."

    "- The third most important feature is Capital-gain and as I was imagining this feature help to determine a high income in the case it has a high value.\n",
    "- The next feature is the Marital-status, parameter that I didn't take into consideration in my answer to question 6. I struggle to find a connection between this features and the income of a person.\n",
    "- The last feature resulted from the analysis is the education-num, a parameter indicating the years an individual has spent on education. It is comprehensible that higher is this number higher will probably be his/her personal income. This feature can also be seen as the continuous equivalent of the Education feature, that I considered in my answer to question 6"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
